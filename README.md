### Our Dataset was an amazon reviews dataset from kaggle.com https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products. 
The dataset contained a list of over 34,000 reviews of Amazon products like the Kindle, Fire TV, ect. It had 21 columns ranging from product asin to the date when review was added. The columns we were concerned about, in regards to the model, were "reviews.text" and "reviews.rating".

###  We created Data Table with filters to showcase, view and study the data.
