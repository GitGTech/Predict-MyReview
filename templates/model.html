                <p>The purpose of this project was to create a model, using NLP and machine learning, which could predict if any given review is positive or negative. The model was trained and tested using data found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The dataset contained a list of over 34,000 reviews of Amazon products like the Kindle, Fire TV, ect. It had 21 columns ranging from product asin to the date the review was added. The columns we were concerned about, in regards to the model, were "reviews.text" and "reviews.rating". However before we could select the relevant columns the data needed to be downloaded and read.

                <img src="/static/images/data.jpg" class="center"/>

                 <p>This was achieved using pandas which is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas, which is derived from "panel data", is capable of accomplishing several task but in regards to extraction it's ability for reading/importing and writing/exporting data between in-memory data structures and different file formats such as csv, excel, json, ect was utilized. A pd.read_csv() function was called on the file path created above and the information was stored into a dataframe named df.</p>

                <p>This bar chart displays the number of gun violence incidents which resulted in either death or injuries during the years of 2014 through 2017 across the United States of America.</p>
                <p>During those four years of time each succesive year resulted in more incidents of gun violene (resulting in death/injuries) than the previous year. However there was an intresting trend in the data.</p>

              <p>After 2014, for the next two years, there was an increase of 3750+ gun related injuries and 1250+ gun related deaths in total per year on average. This positve trend depicted a grim future in regards to gun related violence in the United States. In fact the largest mass shooting in modern United States history occured in October, 2017 (Las Vegas Shootings). That coupled with an insignificant year for federal gun reform it appeared that 2017 would suffer another increase of 3750+ gun related injuries and 1250+ gun related deaths.</p>
              <p>Fortunately that did not occur, thanks to a good year for state level action. More than 30 laws preventing gun violence passed in state legislatures, and more than 200 had been passed since 2013, according to a new report from a gun safety group. It appears that the increased gun reforms on a state level helped reduce the positive trend in gun related incidents. This indicates that there may just be hope for less gun related violence in the United States.</p>
              <p>If creating gun reform on a state level lead to a 97% decrease in the trend of gun injuries and a 50% decrease in the trend of gun killings it can only be assumed that an even more drastic decrease would occur if national gun reform was implimented. In fact, the total number of gun related incidents may begin to decrease as a whole. However, until such reforms are passed by congress the only thing in our power to do is monitor the data closely and hope for the best.</p>
